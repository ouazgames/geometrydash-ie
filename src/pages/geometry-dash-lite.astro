          <h2>Key Features of Geometry Dash Lite</h2>
          <ul>
            <li><strong>Free to play:</strong> No cost, no in-app purchases, completely free</li>
            <li><strong>Curated levels:</strong> Handpicked levels that provide a great introduction to the game</li>
            <li><strong>Responsive controls:</strong> One-button gameplay that's easy to learn but hard to master</li>
            <li><strong>Challenging difficulty:</strong> Levels that gradually increase in difficulty</li>
            <li><strong>Catchy music:</strong> Synchronized soundtrack that matches the gameplay</li>
            <li><strong>Customization:</strong> Unlock new icons and colors as you progress</li>
          </ul>
          
          <h2>How to Play Geometry Dash Lite</h2>
          <p>Playing Geometry Dash Lite is simple: tap or click to make your cube jump. Your character moves automatically from left to right, and you need to time your jumps perfectly to avoid obstacles. The game is all about rhythm and timing.</p>
          
          <p>Each level is synchronized with music, so listening to the beat helps you anticipate where obstacles will appear. Practice mode allows you to place checkpoints and learn difficult sections without restarting from the beginning every time.</p>
          
          <h2>Difficulty Progression</h2>
          <p>Geometry Dash Lite features a well-balanced difficulty curve. Early levels teach you the basics with simple jumps and straightforward obstacles. As you progress, new mechanics are introduced: gravity portals, speed changes, and character transformations.</p>
          
          <p>The later levels in Lite are challenging but fair, providing a good stepping stone before moving to the full version of Geometry Dash. Each level teaches you something new about the game's mechanics.</p>
          
          <h2>Game Modes and Transformations</h2>
          <p>Like the full version, Geometry Dash Lite features multiple game modes where your cube transforms into different shapes. Each form has unique physics and controls that you need to master. The cube, ship, ball, and other forms all behave differently, adding variety to the gameplay.</p>
          
          <h2>Practice Mode</h2>
          <p>Stuck on a difficult section? Use practice mode to place checkpoints and practice specific parts of a level without restarting from the beginning. This feature is essential for learning tough sequences and improving your consistency.</p>
          
          <h2>Customization and Unlockables</h2>
          <p>As you progress through Geometry Dash Lite, unlock new icons, colors, and visual customization options. Personalize your character to make it uniquely yours while you master the challenging levels.</p>
          
          <h2>Why Choose Geometry Dash Lite?</h2>
          <p>If you're new to Geometry Dash, Lite is the perfect starting point. It's completely free, requires no download, and provides enough content to understand if you'll enjoy the full game. Many players use Lite to practice before moving to the more challenging full version.</p>
          
          <h2>Tips for Success</h2>
          <ul>
            <li>Listen carefully to the music—obstacles sync with the beat</li>
            <li>Don't rush; focus on consistency over speed</li>
            <li>Use practice mode extensively to learn difficult sections</li>
            <li>Watch how each game mode behaves before attempting hard levels</li>
            <li>Take breaks to maintain focus and avoid frustration</li>
          </ul>
          
          <h2>Free to Play Online</h2>
          <p>Geometry Dash Lite is completely free to play on geometrydash.ie. No downloads, no registration, and no hidden costs. Just open your browser and start playing instantly.</p>
